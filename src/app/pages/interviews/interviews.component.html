                A: I have always loved Creature Features. Again, they were something I watched from a very young age. Old Godzilla films were easy to access on TV as were films with giant spiders and other man-vs.-nature movies. At a very young age, I became obsessed with vampire films. Vampires were my favorite monster and I continue to seek out rare and unique takes on the vampire...</p>

                A: I write horror with a feminist slant. The Blood Lights is a zombie story but it focuses on women as the source of violence. I am intrested in womens relationship to food and hunger. I feel that our culture perpetuates the idea that women should have small appetites, and I mean that in all realms-food, sex, power...</p>

                    A: I have always been drawn to horror. My maternal grandmother read Edgar Allan Poe tales to me as bedtime stories, so I was introduced to the spooky and macabre at a very young age. Today, I turn to horror as a way of “letting off steam.” After a particularly stressful week, there is nothing I love more than climbing into bed, pulling the covers up, and putting on a really scary movie. It relaxes me...</p>

                    A: Zombies interest me because of their cannibalistic compulsion.  I feel that women tend to be obsessed with food:  with starving themselves, with diets, with equating food with love and acceptance, so I am interested in what happens when the lust for food (in this case, human flesh) overrides the social norms to watch what we eat...</p>
